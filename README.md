# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on property features such as size, location, condition, and nearby facilities using machine learning regression models.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 ML Techniques
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train model  
   `python src/train.py`
3. Predict price  
   `python src/predict.py`

## 📊 Model Performance
- R² Score: ~0.88
- MAE: ~68K
- RMSE: ~132K

These results indicate strong predictive performance for a real-world housing dataset.
